# Netflix-Data-Analysis

# Our dataset consists of movies across various streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and Disney plus. This dataset contains columns like movie name, release year, movie ratings, genres, etc. We have focused on few attributes in this analysis which include (but are not limited to): genre, age group, release year, country of production etc.
# 
# Following are some of the key questions which we have tried to answer from our analysis:
# - Analyzing the genre-platform relationship e.g. movies of which genre are streamed more on which platform? <br>
# - Identifying the target age group for each platform <br>
# - Analyze the release year attribute to find which platform has most of the new movies.<br>
# - Study the country wise production for each platform.
# 
# In addition to this, we have also tried to elaborate on any common trends, exceptions observed in the pattern and what could be the cause for it.
# 
# <!-- We have performed analysis to find answers to the questions like movies of which genre are streamed mostly on which platform? or which countries have the largest movie production on which platform? or Relation between age group and streaming platforms or are new movies or old movies mostly streamed online -->
